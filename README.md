MarioLANG
=========

My interpreter for MarioLANG in C++.

`mariolang.cpp` is the actual interpreter and the `.mlg`-files are sample codes in MarioLANG for testing purposes.
`99bottles.mlg` is not by me. Wouldn't even start it.
`guess.mlg` is _not_ a guessing game, since it just prints "Nr". Yeah well.
