MarioLANG
=========

My interpreter for MarioLANG in C++.
See http://esolangs.org/wiki/MarioLANG for a description of the language.

`mariolang.cpp` is the actual interpreter and the `.mlg`-files are sample codes in MarioLANG for testing purposes.
`genML.js` is a MarioLANG text generator using Node.JS.
`99bottles.mlg` is not by me. Wouldn't even start making it anyway.
